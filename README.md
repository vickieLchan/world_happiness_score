# Predicting a Country's Happiness Score 

This project aims to see if a country's happiness score can be predicted by certain features with a dataset from the World Happiness Report. The dataset had information for about 160 countries ranging from 2012-2019. The happiness score is measured by the Cantril Ladder on a scale from 0-10. Some of the variables examined for being predictors include the country's GDP, level of social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. Additionally, I web-scraped Wikipedia for the annual amount of sunshine for each of the countries in the dataset to see if sunshine was a predictor of happiness.
