# Predicting a Country's Happiness Score 

This project aims to see if we can predict a country's happiness score with a dataset from the World Happiness Report. The dataset had information for about 160 countries ranging from 2012-2019. The happiness score is measured by the Cantril Ladder on a scale from 0-10. Some of the variables examined include the country's GDP, level of social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption.
